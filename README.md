# Learning-and-Development-Dashboard-
Power BI L&amp;D Insights Dashboard -  This project involved creating an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to provide Learning &amp; Development (L&amp;D) insights for HR, training, and department heads. 


Key functionalities:

Data manipulation and transformation: Utilized Power Query Editor to clean, shape, and merge data from various sources like employee, trainer, and trainee records.
Data visualization: Employed various charts and graphs (e.g., bar charts, donut charts, tree maps) to visually represent key metrics like top trainers, training topics, performance trends, and individual trainee adherence to target training hours.
Interactive exploration: Implemented slicers allowing users to filter and explore data based on specific departments, trainers, training topics, and months.
Dynamic theming: Incorporated theme slicers enabling users to customize the dashboard's color scheme according to their preferences.
Conditional formatting: Applied conditional formatting to data labels and visuals to dynamically highlight information based on adherence percentages, enhancing readability and interpretability.
